# 30MFF-site
 Project Name: Waterâ„¢

 Description: The project was to create a website for he 30MFF activity in class. My team's film was about water. Given the simplicity of this activity, I thought a similarly simple webpage design with easy navigation would be fitting. I decided to include all the information in one page with a navigation bar for different sections of the page. I think the final result contains al the relevant information and reflects the simplicity of the project at the same time.

 Process: Firstly, I layed out the three sections of the webpage before including the content. From there, I started including the content of each page and experimenting with different page layouts until the page reached its current state. 

 Reflection: The most significant change in the page was at the third section of the page. At first, I thought I would dedicate it for the cast information. But as I started thinking about the footer, I thought putting the cast information there made more sense. Otherwise, I think the final page reflects what I was going for in terms of design to a high degree.
